\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] Determine differential index for the differential equation.
	\begin{equation*}
		y' = u
	\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Differential index : 0

\fbox{\begin{minipage}[h!]{\textwidth}
		No need to differentiate the above expression to reduce it to an ODE (or) you differentiate the above equation 0 times to reduce it to an ODE. Therefore, index 0
\end{minipage}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(b)] Determine differential index for the differential equation.
	\begin{align*}
		e_1: \dot x = u,\\
		e_2: y = x.
	\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

From $e_1$ and $e_2$ it is clear that $x$ and $y$ are dynamic variables. Therefore, it is clear that we need to differentiate $e_2$ to get $\dot y$. This makes the differential index as 2.
